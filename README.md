# University_RDS

Created a platform for university students to view courses offered, add or drop courses, and see their grades for the current semester.
The main project was developed with simple HTML,CSS,JavaScript for frontend and Django for the backend. The main idea was to learn DevOps whilst
developing this application as this was incorporated in a CI/CD pipeline built using GitHub actions and Continuously Deployed on Heroku with custom pytests
written to automate the testing proccess.
